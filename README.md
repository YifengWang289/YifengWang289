👋 Hi, I’m Yifeng (Chloe) Wang

I’m a Business & Data Analyst with a background at the intersection of data analytics, business and product strategy. I recently completed my Master’s in Information Science at Cornell University, after earning a double major in Finance and Information Systems at Ohio State University.

🔎 What I Do
	•	Build data pipelines and dashboards (SQL, Python, PySpark, Tableau, Power BI) that turn fragmented data into clear, actionable insights.
	•	Develop predictive models and conduct statistical analyses (regression, A/B testing, time series, clustering) to guide decision-making.
	•	Partner with cross-functional teams to translate business needs into technical solutions, from dashboards to models to product roadmaps.
	•	Combine business acumen with technical skills—whether optimizing a go-to-market strategy, running valuation models, or driving product adoption.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages & Analysis: SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn), R, Excel (advanced modeling)
BI & Infra: Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio, AWS (EC2, S3, Glue), Azure
Methods: Regression, Time Series, A/B Testing, Forecasting, Clustering

🌱 Outside of Work
I like experimenting with new tools and ideas — whether that’s prototyping with no-code platforms, exploring how AI can reshape workflows, or learning design practices that bring data to life. I enjoy side projects that let me connect data, strategy, and user experience in creative ways.
